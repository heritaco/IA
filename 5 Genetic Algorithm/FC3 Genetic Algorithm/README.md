During the development of the algorithm, I drew inspiration from Kie Codes work (2020)
and consulted a series of instructional videos by The Coding Train (2016).
Additionally, I received guidance and assistance from ChatGPT during the process.

Throughout the process, I got assistance from ChatGPT to enhance the code's clarity,
resulting, for example. in the removal of unnecessary elements.
